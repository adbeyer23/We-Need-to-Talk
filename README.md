We Need to Talk: Analyzing How Reddit Talks About Mental Health

In this project, I used topic modeling, sentiment analysis and other NLP techniques to get an idea of how Redditors discuss their mental health issues and how people comment on other's problems.

To accomplish this task, I used the Reddit API to obtain 4500 posts and their respective comments from the three most active mental health Subreddits (SuicideWatch, Depression, and Anxiety).

Code and slides used for the presentation are in this repository.
