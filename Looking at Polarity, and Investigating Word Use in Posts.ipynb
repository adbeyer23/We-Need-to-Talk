Hell, those days I'm even afraid to put a pencil, pen or any other tool to paper because I know I won't be able to put anything decent on there anyway, so I won't even try. I used to be full of ideas and motivation to execute them, but now I struggle to come up with the simplest thing to draw..   \n",
       "1  Get out of the house first thing in the morning.. (It takes me 5 hours to get myself out lol, that's the hardest part of the day) . Sit at a library or a coffeeshop with wifi while you look for a job. or at a public park or something if you're in someplace with warm weather. \\n\\nStaying at home makes each day the same. Find a new place to work from everyday. If you just get out, you can wing it everyday, and not have to make a fixed schedule, and still get something productive done.  Also, you won't have to clean your house that often! \\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

       "4                                        I am in a similar place. Except the stupidest thing is holding me back. My cat. I raised him from a little tiny baby and I'm the only one in the world that knows him and loves him and no matter how much I hate myself or want to die I can't abandon this fuzzy little cat who's never shown me anything but love. I don't know what is best for anyone, but maybe if you get a dog or a cat and you know they depend on you it will help? It certainly hasn't stopped the depression but it stopped me from killing myself.    \n",

Cleaning your apartment and watching a movie are actually pretty great things to add in between all the crying, I should try that. Do you work or study? If not, why don't you try something related to fitness or creativity? I don't know if this is appropriate to post on /r/depression, but you should maybe try checking out /r/90daysgoal/ ? I haven't joined in on a round in a while, and you don't necessarily have to, but it's a very positive place full of examples of daily/weekly schedules and goals you might look forward to reading.

       "2  I agree so much. They basically only care if they have to. Like my parents, well they were forced into this position. Like my brother, who doesn't give a shit to the fact that he drives down my mood by picking on my irritability. Like my friends, constantly saying \"they care and they're there for you\" but never showing it, not even trying. Like my school, that was forced to care about me the two weeks after coming out of A&E, and now does not give a shit.\\n\\nI'm sick and tired of empty words and people saying they care. Like fuck you and don't you dare say it if you don't actually care. Stop doing it to try and look good by doing it, doing it to reassure yourself you're a good person. If you care, fucking do something. Stop talking about how you're feeling dealing with me and how it's hard for you. Start talking about how I'm dealing with me and how it's hard for me to live with myself.   \n",

       "0  Illustrator here, the well of creativity dries up whenever things get worse. Hell, those days I'm even afraid to put a pencil, pen or any other tool to paper because I know I won't be able to put anything decent on there anyway, so I won't even try. I used to be full of ideas and motivation to execute them, but now I struggle to come up with the simplest thing to draw.. I'm an artist and it has *greatly* affected me; I've noticed my great trouble with creative work now and as a result I do more 'traditional work' which requires just observation and not imaginative thought. \\n\\n\\nAnd that really upsets me. It's such a big part of me, and I'm holding on to it, I'm *afraid* of losing that. \\n I'm not the most creative person myself,but I feel the same way sometimes. For me, it's like my somewhat creative \"flow\" is just gone or not there.         I was a pretty good poet in grade 5. 15 years later, I can't write a thing. fuck yeah it has, im too fuckin nervous to be creative around peo...  \n",
       "1  Get out of the house first thing in the morning.. (It takes me 5 hours to get myself out lol, that's the hardest part of the day) . Sit at a library or a coffeeshop with wifi while you look for a job. or at a public park or something if you're in someplace with warm weather. \\n\\nStaying at home makes each day the same. Find a new place to work from everyday. If you just get out, you can wing it everyday, and not have to make a fixed schedule, and still get something productive done.  Also, you won't have to clean your house that often! \\n\\n\\n\\n I would start by adding in one productive, happy activity for at least half an hour a day. Cleaning your apartment and watching a movie are actually pretty great things to add in between all the crying, I should try that. Do you work or study? If not, why don't you try something related to fitness or creativity? I don't know if this is appropriate to post on /r/depression, but you should maybe try checking out /r/90daysgoal/ ?

       "2  *Nobody* gives a fuck about depression. Rant on man. Thats what we're here for. I agree so much. They basically only care if they have to. Like my parents, well they were forced into this position. Like my brother, who doesn't give a shit to the fact that he drives down my mood by picking on my irritability. Like my friends, constantly saying \"they care and they're there for you\" but never showing it, not even trying. Like my school, that was forced to care about me the two weeks after coming out of A&E, and now does not give a shit.\\n\\nI'm sick and tired of empty words and people saying they care. Like fuck you and don't you dare say it if you don't actually care. Stop doing it to try and look good by doing it, doing it to reassure yourself you're a good person. If you care, fucking do something. Stop talking about how you're feeling dealing with me and how it's hard for you. Start talking about how I'm dealing with me and how it's hard for me to live with myself.         I agree ...  \n",
       "3  That last line made me smile. Thank you :) \"I'll outlive you, you stupid piece of shit.\"\\n\\nThat's the spirit. I would've never actually thought that thought, but thats right on the money.  >I told her I feel depressed and she said \"There's no such thing as depression\"\\n\\nYou're not losing anything of value by ending that relationship. What an asshole.         I know this post is old, but that last line made me smile. It's almost silly the kinds of things that keep us going sometimes. But they keep us trucking nonetheless. Made my bad night just a little better. Thank you.\\n\\nOh, and fuck her. She doesn't fucking deserve you, man. Dude I'm sorry you ex is such a bitch. Prove her wrong and have an awesome life Jesus, you did yourself a favor by breaking up with her.\\n\\nAlso, those last two sentences? Awesome stuff right there. That did not go in the direction I was expecting it to.  My justice boner is throbbing now. My ex was exactly like that. Pure poison. After we split, I told h...  \n",
       "4  I am in a similar place. Except the stupidest thing is holding me back. My cat. I raised him from a little tiny baby and I'm the only one in the world that knows him and loves him and no matter how much I hate myself or want to die I can't abandon this fuzzy little cat who's never shown me anything but love. I don't know what is best for anyone, but maybe if you get a dog or a cat and you know they depend on you it will help? It certainly hasn't stopped the depression but it stopped me from killing myself.  You don't want to kill yourself. Obviously not if you came on here looking for answers. Looking for help. Looking for a way to end your depression. Maybe just support. Or maybe I'm wrong and you just want everyone to know life isn't just sunshines and daisies. But if I'm right, and you do want help, that's what I want to offer. My help.\\n\\nFirst off, here's a list of guidelines or whatnot for depression.\\n1.) It sucks\\n2.)

I love them with all of my heart, but I'm so confused about how. I'm confused to the point where I feel like my mind is ripped apart. I'm angry at myself because I sincerely thought that they were normal parents up until several weeks ago and that I was the screw-up, causing them to act the way they did.

My friend was in Brussels for March Break, I talked to him all morning about how he was so lucky to make it out and not be caught up in the chaos. I left a comment on the top voted post about the attacks and headed off to 2nd period.\\n\\nI was in 2nd period and I see I got a reply to the comment, I opened it and it was a counter argument talking about how IsIs want us to fight back so they have a reason to keep terrorizing the world. Mid way reading through it my right side went numb (My face wasn't dropping and I could speak clearly.) I felt numb, overwhelmed, confused,I told myself that I was going to die and upset.\\n\\nI ended up going to the doctors on the same day, before that my school first aid assistance said she didn't think It was a stroke.

    "There results are quite intesting. Really neagtive posts use way more generic coping and generic drug/medical references then the most positive do. For specific medicine references it is about equal usage, and the most positive posts use almost double the amount of non-generic coping references. What to make of this? It's hard to say. It is possible that the polarity difference might signify depression or anxiety severity or that the more positive posts are people sharing how they got over their disorder or are just farther along in treating it. It is also possible that the more positive posts are representive of people who are very driven to get over their disorder or have certain character traits that cause them to look more at the specifics. Maybe the more negative posts signify that the person is really lost and know they should try things like \"exercise\" or \"antidepressants\" but don't know how to move forward with either of those."
