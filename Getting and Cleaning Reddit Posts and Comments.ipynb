Nearly 30 years old with no friends, no love life, no close family relationships and generally no one who would enjoy spending time with me.\\nI emigrated to USA as a young child and always had trouble fitting in. I had a group of friends back in high school but I was always the outcast of the group. My interests never really did match up with theirs and try as I might, I never did feel comfortable with them. I stayed in contact with them throughout college by attending the few lunches or dinners they had once or twice a year. Over time, I have lost touch with all of them. A few friends I did manage to make in university never reach out to me. I tried getting in contact with one of them recently and was flat out ignored. \\nThis brings me to where I am now. I am tired, I am lonely and I just wanted to share my sad pathetic life with everyone on the internet. I don't want to die and I'm not suicidal but I don't want to feel th...   \n",

       "3  Rinse and Repeat Every day I crawl out of bed and get ready for school. When I get there I force myself to put on a smile. Everyone I know has their problems and that makes me feel selfish for feeling so out of energy, worn out, useless, an outsider. Every day, week, month, even hour, it’s the same cycle. I try to think today will be better, like I won’t end the night wishing that this will be my last sleep. The little bit of hope soon diminishes to dread towards the day. So many people, so many choices, so many outcomes; and I’m not even a cog in the machine. \\n   I arrive and meet with my friends, I call them friends because I don’t know what else to call people I talk to, people I depend on, people I have to see everyday. I converse with them knowing that I will never be as whole as they are. I feel bad for thinking that their lives are better than mine but from what they’ve shown me the statement stands. I chime in a joke to try to lighten my heavy heart and mind. This slowly t...   \n",

I'm a 20 year old college freshman (don't ask about the age thing. I had to take a year off for physical health) at a Big Ten school (for those who don't know, it's a conference of large state universities, mostly in the Midwest US). I've had nothing to do and no one to do anything with, and I was diagnosed with depression earlier this semester. The last two nights I've drank alone in my dorm room because everyone else was out having fun, at date parties. It honestly makes me feel better for a bit, but I'm worried that I'm going to have a problem. Before this, I drank no more than 1-2 times per month, only heavily 2-3 times per year. I don't know what to do.   \n",

I have so many regrets and now I'm so damn lonely. I have always found it extremely difficult to interact and socialize with other people. The very few friends I've had in my life had abandoned me. I ask myself, \"why?\". I love making people laugh, I love putting a smile on their face, and I feel that I'm pretty good at it too. I've been such a kind person my entire life. Why did the vast majority of my friends leave me? Why do people judge and avoid me? Depression is like a disease and every time you think it's over, it just kicks you back down even harder than before. I keep telling myself, \"I have the rest of my life to fix this\", every day this hope to achieve true happiness, to one day fit into society, to one day have friends who won't leave me or betray me.

Just another thing she would have to get used to, along with spotting a few new wrinkles on her face earlier in the week and the constant pain in various body parts, I guess it was inevitable, getting older. \\n\\nIt was cold in her tiny flat, so she went back to bed and nestled back in the warm space she had created over night.\\n\\nWhat shall I do today, she pondered, writing a list in her head of all the things needed to be done.

I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.\\n\\nEDIT: Just came home and saw your replies.

I did it.\n",
